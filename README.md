# Garbage Lisp  
Well it works but isn't good.

**Go** is definitely not the best language to do this, so it came out kinda hacky with **Go** Interfaces.

I coded this to learn about Interpreters, so this is definitely not a good example nor it works like most lisps so far.

I tried following this guide http://norvig.com/lispy.html, yet I had to change a lot of stuff because **Go** isn't Dynamically
typed like **Python** and would be easier to code this using some language that has generics. 
I'm not saying that **Go** needs them, I like it's minimalism :) .

# TODO
- Strings
- User defined functions
- Quotation
- Better error messages
- More native/out of the box functions and constants
- Remove unused "Methods"
- Files
- Comments 
- Overall improve the interaction with the interpreter (REPL, File, ETC)
- Improve Prints
- "Debug Mode"
- Add some examples
- Add concurrency (jk)

(To be honest this looks more like a Shopping list)


# How to Run
